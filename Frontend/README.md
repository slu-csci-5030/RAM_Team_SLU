# Addressed Issues
## Home page _ Login Popup

For our project requirement we needed to create a homepage with login and sign up options. 
On 11/2/24 we built some essential components 
1. For testing frame we are using [JEST](https://jestjs.io/), [REACT Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) with [React Scripts Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts). 
2. For unit testing we decided to test the functionality of the login button. Upon clicking on login, *A window should pop up allows them to login to their account*

## How to run tests :
1. Clone the repository
2. (As we have written the unit test for frontend) Navigate to Frontend folder of the project and run the following command :
*npm install* (make sure to check you are in Frontend folder of project) to install the dependencies of the project
3. Now to perform the unit testing, run the following command :
*npm run test* (make sure to check you are in Frontend folder of project)
4. You can find the execution status of unit tests in the terminal.
